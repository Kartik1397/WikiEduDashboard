                Thank you for participating in the Wikipedia Student Program during
                #{link_to @campaign.title, "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/campaigns/#{@campaign.slug}", class: 'link'}!
                You and your students were part of a cohort of #{@campaign.courses.count} courses whose #{@campaign.students.count} students
                contributed roughly #{number_to_human @presenter.word_count, delimiter: ','} words to Wikipedia. You can refer back to your
                %a.link{href: "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/courses/#{@course.slug}"} course page
                at any time to see what your students did on Wikipedia.

              %p.paragraph
                If you've taught more than one course with us, just go to
                %a.link{href: "https://#{ENV['dashboard_url']}/my_account"} your profile page
                to see your collective impact.

              %p.paragraph
                Thank you again.

                Best Wishes,
